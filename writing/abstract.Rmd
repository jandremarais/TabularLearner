In this thesis we set out to investigate an area of deep learning, \textit{viz}. the application of deep learning approaches to tabular datasets.
The deep learning field is an extention of the class of machine learning algorithms called \textit{Artificial Neural Networks}.
Currently, deep learning is receiving a remarkable amount of attention, both in research and in practice.
Deep learning models excel in tasks processing unstructured data, especially in the domains of computer vision, natural language processing and audio processing.

A data domain in which deep learning have not yet been very successful, is that of tabular data.
Many important machine learning applications make use of tabular data and currently the best machine learning models for tabular data are tree-based models.
Therefore it is of our opinion that this direction warrants further research.
This work is an exploratory study, evaluating the current state of the field and what is needed for it to progress.
The contribution made by this work is 2-fold.
The first part constitutes a literature review of the latest developments in deep learning.
We highlight all the major developments in field and specifically evaluate them through the lense of aiding in the endeavour of improving deep learning for tabular data.
From this research we also identify the major challenges of applying deep learning to tabular data and suggest ways of improving on this front.

The second major contribution is an empirical study of the most promosing deep learning developments highlighted in the literature review.
We build a code base for implementing the latest deep learning techniques and doing comparitive experiments for model selection.
Through various experiments we evaluate the validity of the findings in the literature and comment on the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
