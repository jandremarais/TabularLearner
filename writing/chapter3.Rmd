## Regularisation

### Dropout

Interesetingly, [@haldar2018] found that dropout was not effective in their application.
They pinned it down to dropout producing invalid input scenarious that distracted the model.
Therefore they opted for hand crafted noise shapes taking into account the distribution of the relevant feature.

+ reduce training time and increase performace

Currently the process of setting the hyper-parameters, including designing the network architecture, requires expertise and extensive trial and error and is based more on serendipity than science. 

Currently there are no simple and easy ways to set hyper-parameters – specifically, learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay.
Grid search or random search is expensive.
Optimal parameters make a huge difference in training time and performance.

Look for clues of overfitting and underfitting to determine best parameters.

The experiments discussed herein indicate that the learning rate, momentum, and regularization are tightly coupled and optimal values must be determined together.

by monitoring validation/test loss early in the training, enough information is available to tune the
architecture  and  hyper-parameters  and  this  eliminates  the  necessity  of  running  complete  grid  or
random searches.

Underfitting is when the machine learning model is unable to reduce the error for either the test or
training set.  The cause of underfitting is an under
capacity
of the machine learning model; that is,
it is not powerful enough to fit the underlying complexities of the data distributions.  Overfitting
happens  when  the  machine  learning  model  is  so  powerful  as  to  fit  the  training  set  too  well  and
the generalization error increases.

The takeaway is that
achieving the horizontal part of the test loss is the goal of hyper-
parameter tuning

The art of setting the network’s hyper-parameters amounts to ending up at the balance point between
underfitting and overfitting

If the learning rate (LR) is too small, overfitting can occur.  Large learning rates help to regularize
the training but if the learning rate is too large, the training will diverge.

To use CLR, one specifies minimum and maximum learning rate boundaries and a stepsize. The
stepsize is the number of iterations (or epochs) used for each step and a cycle consists of two such
steps – one in which the learning rate linearly increases from the minimum to the maximum and
the other in which it linearly decreases. 

n the LR range test, training starts with a small learning rate which is slowly increased linearly
throughout a pre-training run.  This single run provides valuable information on how well the net-
work can be trained over a range of learning rates and what is the maximum learning rate.  When
starting with a small learning rate, the network begins to converge and, as the learning rate increases,
it eventually becomes too large and causes the test/validation loss to increase and the accuracy to
decrease.  The learning rate at this extrema is the largest value that can be used as the learning rate
for the maximum bound with cyclical learning rates but a smaller value will be necessary when
choosing a constant learning rate or the network will not begin to converge.

the amount of regularization must be balanced for each dataset
and architecture

Contrary to this early work, this Section recommends using a larger batch size when using
the 1cycle learning rate schedule, which is described in the above

Weight decay is one form of regularization and it plays an important role in training so its value needs
to be set properly.  The important point made above applies; that is, practitioners must balance the
various forms of regularization to obtain good performance. the interested reader can see kuka et al. (2017) for a review of regularization methods.

1.  Learning rate (LR): Perform a learning rate range test to a “large” learning rate.  The max
LR depends on the architecture (for the shallow 3-layer architecture, large is 0.01 while for
resnet, large is 3.0), you might try more than one maximum.  Using the 1cycle LR policy
with a maximum learning rate determined from an LR range test, a minimum learning rate
as a tenth of the maximum appears to work well but other factors are relevant, such as the
rate of learning rate increase (too fast and increase will cause instabilities).

2.  Total batch size (TBS): A large batch size works well but the magnitude is typically con-
strained by the GPU memory. If your server has multiple GPUs, the total batch size is the
batch size on a GPU multiplied by the number of GPUs. If the architecture is small or your
hardware permits very large batch sizes, then you might compare performance of different
batch sizes.  In addition, recall that small batch sizes add regularization while large batch
sizes add less, so utilize this while balancing the proper amount of regularization. It is often
better to use a larger batch size so a larger learning rate can be used.

3.  Momentum:  Short runs with momentum values of 0.99, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.9 will quickly
show the best value for momentum. If using the 1cycle learning rate schedule, it is better to
use a cyclical momentum (CM) that starts at this maximum momentum value and decreases
with increasing learning rate to a value of 0.8 or 0.85 (performance is almost independent
of the minimum momentum value).  Using cyclical momentum along with the LR range
test stabilizes the convergence when using large learning rate values more than a constant
momentum does.

4.  Weight decay (WD): This requires a grid search to determine the proper magnitude but
usually  does  not  require  more  than  one  significant  figure  accuracy.   Use  your  knowl-
edge of the dataset and architecture to decide which values to test.  For example, a more
complex dataset requires less regularization so test smaller weight decay values. A  shallow  architecture  requires  more  regularization  so  test  largerweight decay values.


### Autoencoders

An autoencoder takes an input and first transforms it into some (smaller) latent representation using the part of the network called the encoder.
From the latent representation the second part of the network, called the decoder, tries to reconstruct the input by doing some transformation.
Both the encoder and the decoder networks are NNs in their own right and thus usually consist of either fully conncected layers or convolutional layers (or both).

During training a reconstruction loss is minimised.
A reconstruction loss measures the distance between the reconstruction of the input based on the latent representation and the actual input.

Autoencoders technically belong the self (or semi) supervised class of methods, although many still think of it as unsupervised.
It is unsupervised in the sense that it does not require labelling, but it is stll supervised in the sense that it predicts an ouput; the input and thus self-supervised.

### Denoising Autoencoders

A denoising autoencoder (DAE) is a variant of the vanilla autoencoder.
A DAE also learns to reconstruct the input vector, but in this case from a corrupted version thereof.
So during training, before an input is sent through the encoder, it first get injected with random noise.
However, the output of the decoder is still being compared to the original input and thus the DAE is supposed to learn how to remove noise from the input - therefore, denoising.

[@Miotto2016] used a stacked denoising autoencoder to learn patient representations from EHR data.
They found that these representations were useful features in predicting future health states of patients.
By using these learned representations as input significantly improved the performance of predictive models compared to those only using the raw inputs.

# Neural Networks for Tabular Data

It is not exactly clear why DNNs are still in many cases inferior to gradient boosted trees when applied to tabular data, eventhough it outperforms all other algorithms in other application domains like text and speech. 
We can look for differences between tabular data and unstructured data in their properties to try and understand why this is the case.
A difference between the two data types that stand out is the relative importance of each of the important features with respect to the target. 
In computer vision a large amount of pixels should change before an image is of something else.
Whereas in tabular data a very small change in a single feature may have totally different behaviour with respect to the target [@Shavitt2018].
The same authors mention that this can be addressed by including a separate reqularisation term for each of the weights in the network. 
These regularisation terms are seen as additional model hyperparameters.
It is easy to see that this approach is totally intractable since the only way to train these hyperpararmeters are brute force and repetitive tweaking and validatig (derivative free methods).
A workaround is to make these regularisation parameters trainable like all of the other points in the network.
This is achieved by minimising the counterfactual loss, a novel loss function proposed by [@Shavitt2018].
They found that training NNs by optimising the counterfactual loss, outperform other regularisation approaches for NNs and results in NNs that are comparable to gradient boosted trees.
The learned regularisation parameters can even help with interpretting feature importance.

- NNs proved to be useful for tabular data at AirBnB [@haldar].

## Entity Embeddings

Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up neural networks compared with one-hot encoding, but more importantly by mapping similar values close to each other in the embedding space it reveals the intrinsic properties of the categorical variables, which you cannot obtain with one-hot encoding.

Companies like [Instacart](https://tech.instacart.com/deep-learning-with-emojis-not-math-660ba1ad6cdc) and [Pinterest](https://medium.com/the-graph/applying-deep-learning-to-related-pins-a6fee3c92f5e) have reported the effective use of entity embeddings on their internal datasets. 
These embeddings can be reused on different machine learning tasks and do have to be relearned for each dataset.

First published work in modern times on entity embeddings was in the taxi destination prediction challenge [@Brebisson2015].
Another Kaggle sucess story is for predicting the total sales of a store [@Guo2016].
This embedding of discrete data was inspired by work done word embeddings in the Natural Language Processing community.
There a word is mapped into a vector space of fixed size.
The vector representing a word is known as its embedding.
The table of embeddings for the words in the dataset is included in the model as a paramterised mapping that can be learned in the same way as the rest of the NN layers.
The parameters of the embedding function (or layer) are first randomly initialised and then gets tuned along with the rest of the NN during training.

The embedding for discrete variables act in the exact same way.
The embdding for each categorical variable gets concatenated to the continuous variables and then gets passed to the rest of the layers in the network.

In [@Brebisson2015] they found that embeddings helped a lot. 
The embeddings can also be visualised to investigate whether make sense or to gain further insight into the data and model decision making.
The weights associated with each categories projection onto the embedding space can be plotted with any dimension reduction technique like t-sne or PCA.
Then we can compare the categoires based on their relative distances and positions in this reduced space.

Entity embeddings are not too different to one-hot encoding a categorical input and sending it through a standard fully connected layer.
An embedding is essentailly the same operation but a separate one for each of the categorical features.
Doing it this way reduces memory usage and speeds up training of a NN. 
This makes is incredibly useful for datasets with high cardinality features and many of them.
It will also not be possible to interpret categories based on its embedding of the one-hot encoded path is followed.

We further demonstrate in this paper that entity embedding helps the neural network to generalize better when the data is sparse and statistics is unknown [@Guo2016].

As proof that these entity embeddings actually learns something useful, besides plotting the embedding matrix, one can also feed them along with the continuous features to other learning algorithms and see how it affects performance.
[@Guo2016] found that the embeddings obtained from the trained neural network boosted the performance of all tested machine learning methods considerably when used as the input features. 


## Normalising Continuous Variables

One of the things that make tree-based methods so attractive is that the numeric values of the features hardly matter, as long as their relative ordering is meaningful.
On the other hand, NNs are very sensitive to the numeric value of the input. 
This is related to the optimisation procedure.
If an abnormal feature value is fed to the network during training, large gradients can backpropogate throught the network and/or result in vanishing gradients [@Clevert2015].

[@haldar2018] suggest to restrict the values in the range of {-1,1} and so that the median is mapped to zero.
They achieved this by inspecting each of the features and if a feature looks gaussian, do the normalisation $(x-\mu)/\sigma$ and if the feature looks more like a power law distribution, transform is by $\log\left((1+x)/(1+\text{median})\right)$.

Another step the same authors suggest is to ensure the continuous variables follow a smooth distribution.
This helps for generalisation, checking for bugs and general training efficiency.
It also helps the analyst to determine whether a feature is generated by some other underlying process.

## Data augmentation

As mentioned before, our aim with predictive models is to generalise well to an unseen test set.
In an ideal world we would train a model on all possible variations of the data to capture all interactions and relationships.
This is not possible in the real world.
Such a dataset is not available and would be infinitely large.

In reality we have a finite subset of the full data distribution to train on.
Any new samples with unique feature combinations will likely improve the models generalisablity.
If the collection of new samples is not available, we can try to artificially create more.

This is a standard approach especially in computer vision applications. For example, from a single image, we can rotate it, flip it horizontally, shift it any direction, crop it, and many other transformations without destroying the semantic content of the image.
But by doing so we are artificially increasing the size of the training set to help with overfitting.
Of course this is not as effective as genuine new data samples, but it is a very effective and efficient substitute [@Perez2017].

Tabular data is very different to image data and the standard augmentations used in computer vision does not make sense with tabular data.
You cannot rotate or scale an observation from a tabular data without losing its meaning.
One transformation that does make sense for tabular input is the injection of random noise.

When working with images, we can randomly perturb the pixel intensities by a small amount so that it is still possible to make sense of its content.
By adding 1 for example to all pixels and all colors in an image, will only make it slightly brighter and we will still be able to make sense of it.
Bu with tabular data we can just randomly add a small amount to any feature.
The input features will probably not all be on the same scale and the addition of noise might result in a feature value that is out of the true distribution. 
In addition, it does not make sense to add anything to a discrete variables.
Thus in order to inject random noise to a tabular data sample, the noise should be scaled relative to each input feature range and the results should be a valid value for that feature.
This also helps the model to be more robust to small variations in the data.

[@VanDerMaaten2013] suggests an augmentation approach that does this called Marginalised Corrupted Features (MCF).
The MCF approach adds noise to input from some known distribution.

In the original Denoising Autoencoding papaer [@Vincent2008], they used a blank-out corruption procedure.
Which is randomly selecting a subset of the input features and mask their values with a zero.
The only conceptual problem with this approach is that for some features a zero value actually carries some meaning, so a suggestion is to blank-out features with a unique value not already belonging to that feature distribution.

Another input corruption approach shown to work empirically [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/44629) is what is called Swap Noise [@kasar2018].
The swap noise procedure corrupts inputs by randomly swapping input values with those of other samples in the datasets.
In this way you ensure that the corrupted input at least have valid feature values.
But it still might produce combinations of features that are not actually possible.

  All of these methods have hyperparameters that needs to be set. I haven't gone into detail as I still need to decide what is relevant to this thesis.

# Interpreting Neural Networks

## Introduction

Although Deep Learning is now the state-of-the-art for many machine learning tasks, it still trailing behind other algorithms in terms of model interpretability.
But keep in mind this is not an unusual trade-off; between prediction performance and model interpretability.
DNNs are occasionally referred to as "black boxes" since it is very difficult to interpret what is going on inside the stacks of linear and non-linear layers.
This one of deep learning's greatest criticisms and is large reason why it cannot be used in some production environments. 
For example, in the clinical domain, model transparency is of utmost importance, given that predictions  might be used to affect real-world medical decision-making and patient treatments [@Shickel2017].

Fortunately, some work has been done to gain insights from NNs.

## Model Agnostic

### Permutation Importance

[@haldar2018] notes that the permutation test only produces sensical results on the assumption that the features are independent.
Permuting the feature independently created examples that never occurred in real life, and the importance of features in that invalid space sent us in the wrong direction. 
The test however is somewhat useful in determining features that were not pulling their weight.
If randomly permuting a feature did not affect the model performance at all, it was a good indication that the model is probably not dependent on it.
