# Deep Learning \label{chp:dl}

## Introduction

Deep learning is a broadly used term.
The difference between a classical neural network and a deep neural network, is merely its number of layers.
Even a network with two hidden layers is sometimes referred to as deep.

In this work, we use the term deep learning to refer to modern developments in the space of neural networks.
In the last decade, tons of contributions have been made to the field: new types of layers, different ways of training and novel approaches to fight overfitting.
Reviewing these developments requires much more space than a chapter, therefore, for the purpose of this work, we only highlight the developments we feel are important for our next chapter on deep learning for tabular data.

Practically all deep learning developments are aimed at combatting overfitting, either explicitly or implicitly.
Since neural networks can already approximate any function, but our learning algorithms cannot necassrily find these solutions, we need ways of learning more efficiently from the data.
This chapter starts by introducing a different class of neural networks called *autoencoders* (\Sref{sec:ae}).
Autoencoders are mostly used as an unsupervised learning technique to help us learn more robust representations from data without labelled data, which we may then transfer to supervised learning algorithms.
This process of transferring knowledge from one network to another is called transfer learning, which we discuss in \Sref{sec:tl}.

Thereafter, we look at layers that help with regularisation: *dropout* (\Sref{sec:dropout}) and *batch normalisation* (\Sref{sec:bnorm}).
Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially enlarge the training dataset and thus also helps fighting overfitting.
We discuss this in \Sref{sec:daug}.
The other types of layers we look at in this chapter are, *skip-connections* (\Sref{sec:resnet}), *attention* modules (\Sref{sec:attention}) and *embedding* layers (\Sref{sec:embeds}).
They are designed to make deeper neural networks more effective, let them focus more on the important features and to process discrete input, respectively.

Then we devote a section to a training policy called the *1cycle* policy (\Sref{sec:onecyc}).
This method provides a way of automatically finding a good learning rate and drastically reduces the number of training iterations needed.
We conclude this chapter with a discussion on the interpretability of neural networks (\Sref{sec:interp}).

## Denoising Autoeoncoders \label{sec:ae}

The basic autoencoder is a neural network that is trained to attempt to reconstruct its inputs.
The simplest form of an autoencoder is a neural network with with one hidden layer and an output layer the same size of the input layer (illustrated in \autoref{fig:ae}).
The linear layer transforming the input to the hidden layer is referred to as the encoder, $\boldsymbol{z}=f(\boldsymbol{x})$, and the layer producing the output from the hidden layer is called the decoder, $\boldsymbol{x}'=g(\boldsymbol{z})$.
The autoencoder can be trained in the same way as any other neural network, but by minimising a reconstruction loss.
A reconstruction loss measures the distance between the reconstruction of the input and the actual input and thus the MSE loss function is common choice for continuous data.

```{r, fig.cap="A simple single hidden layer autoencoder with 4-dimensional inputs and 2 neurons in the hidden layer.\\label{fig:ae}", out.height="30%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/ae.png')
```

Autoencoders technically belong to the self- (or semi-) supervised class of methods, although many still think of it as unsupervised.
It is unsupervised in the sense that it does not require labelling, but it is stll supervised in the sense that it predicts an ouput.

In this setting, if the number of neurons in the hidden layer is greater than or equal to the number of input features, the autoencoder will be able to perfectly reconstruct $\boldsymbol{x}$ from $\boldsymbol{z}$, *i.e.* $\boldsymbol{x}'=\boldsymbol{x}$.
However this is not a very useful model and instead autoencoders are usually built with some type of constraint imposed.
A common option is to restrict the number of neurons in the hidden layer to be smaller than the number of input features.
This forces the autoencoder to capture only the most useful properties of the data in the hidden representation and can thus effectively be used as a way of dimensionality reduction [@Hinton2006a].
When there are no non-linear activation functions after the linear layers, one can show that this autoencoder is equivalent to a *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA) of the inputs.

There is no restriction in the number or the size of the layers used for the encoder and decoder, and if activation functions are used, one can potentially learn a more powerful non-linear generalisation of PCA.
However, if the encoder and decoder networks are allowed too much capacity, the autoencoder can learn to reconstuct the inputs without learning useful properties of the data.
It is hard to tell if an autoencoder has learned a useful latent representation of the data.
One way to evaluate it is to use the features extracted by the encoder for a supervised learning task and compare its performance with a model using the raw data as inputs.
Autoencoders have also been used to initialise the weights of a supervised learning network, *i.e.* using the learned weight of the autoencoder as the initial weights for the supervised learning network of the same size [@Larochelle2009].

An autoencoder can learn to perfectly copy the input if the encoder and decoder have enough capacity, even though the latent representation is of a smaller diemsion than the inputs, and thus will not learn useful features of the data.
Therefore we may want to consider other types of contraints to impose on the autoencoder.

A *denoising autoencoder* (DAE) [@Vincent2008] first adds noise to its inputs before it is passed to the encoder.
Thus in order to minimise the reconstruction loss, the DAE should learn how to reconstruct the original input from a corrupted version of itself.
[@Alain2014] shows that DAEs do learn useful structures of the data.

The choice of the type of noise added to the inputs depends on the data types.
One can block out inputs with zeros if zeros have no other meaning in the data or one might want to add gaussian noise to continuous outputs as long as it falls within the true range of the features.
If there is too much noise in the corruption step, the DAE might not learn anything useful.
The type and amount of noise to be use are things that should be experimented with.

Another type of autoencoder is a *Variational Autoencoder* (VAE) [@Kingma2013].
Instead of encoding the data into a latent vector representation, a VAE encodes the data as a Gaussian distribution.
In the decoding step, observations are then sampled from the learned distribution before passing it to the fully connected layers.
This is an interesting direction for future research but not in the scope of this work.

## Pretraining and Transfer Learning \label{sec:tl}

Unsupervised learning played a key part in the rise of deep learning (debatedly starting with [@Hinton2006]).
It made it easier to train deeper neural networks with a process called *pretraining*.
Pretraining is based on the assumption that representations learned from one task can sometimes be useful for accomplishing other tasks in the same input domain.
For example, we can use a DAE to learn the structure of the data from unlabelled data and then use what it has learned as features or initialisation for a supervised learning task with the same type of inputs.
We can also do supervised pretraining by first training the network to estimate one target variable and then use those weights or features when training to estimate a different target variable, for example.

Unsupervised pretraining for supervised learning is very common in NLP [@Devlin2018, @Howard2018] and supervised pretraining for supserivsed learning is very common in computer vision [@Yosinski2015, @He2015].
It is not yet clear theoretically why pretraining works.
It may be that using the pretrained weights as initialisation to the supervised model provides a better starting position on the loss surface and thus have regulartory effects [@Goodfellow2016, Ch. 14].
Pretraining is most effective when there is little data available for the supervised task but a lot of data available for the pretraining task.

The process of transferring what is learned doing one task (for example in pretraining) to another task (supervised learning for examples) is called *transfer learning*. When done effectively, pretraining and transfer learning can together dramatically reduce the number of training samples and computational power need to train a model.

[@Zeiler2014] provides an insigtful investigation of the what a CNN learns when trained on image data. 
From observing the types of features extracted for a trained image model (\autoref{fig:zeil}) it becomes clear why they are also effective on other image datasets. 
The learned filters seemed to look for generic image features like edges and color gradients which are useful for most computer vision tasks.
[@Howard2018] describes a good practice when doing transfer learning via gradual unfreezing and discriminative fine-tuning.

```{r, fig.cap="Visualising the first layer convolutional filters leared by a neural network in a large image dataset. \\label{fig:zeil}", out.height="50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/zeiler_filters.jpeg")
```

## More Regularisation

In \Sref{sec:basicreg} we discussed basic regularisation methods for neural networks.
There are many other ways of combatting overfitting.
The following section discusses two regularisation techniques proven to be extremely powerful in almost every application of deep learning.

### Dropout \label{sec:dropout}

*Dropout* consists of randomly setting the output of a hidden neuron to zero with probability $p$.
See \autoref{fig:dropout} for an illustration of how dropout effects the connections between neurons.
The neurons which are set to zero do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in backpropogation. 
Every time an input is presented, the neural network samples a different set of neurons to be dropped out. 

This technique ensures that a neuron does not rely on the signals of a particular set of other neurons,
It is therefore forced to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other units [@Krizhevsky2012].

In the original paper they used $p=0.5$ but the optimal selection will depend on the use case and is typically found by experimentation.
At test time, no units are dropped out and their output is multiplied by $1-p$ to compensate for the fact that all of the units are now active. 
Dropout does tremendously well to combat overfitting, but it slows down the covergence time of training.

There are also parallels to be drawn between dropout and ensembling approaches [@Hinton2012].
Since, at each training iteration a unique set of neurons are active which may then each be viewed as unique models.
During training these models are combined - similar to the process of ensembling models.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The effect dropout has on connections between neurons.\\label{fig:dropout}", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/dropout.png')
```


### Data Augmentation \label{sec:daug}

Recall that our aim with predictive models is to generalise well to an unseen test set.
In an ideal world we would train a model on all possible variations of the data to capture all interactions and relationships.
This is not possible in the real world.
Such a dataset is not available and would be infinitely large.
And even if it were, machine learning will then be unecessary since all the possible observations are observable and one could simply use a lookup or a search when predicting outcomes.

In reality we have a finite subset of the full data distribution to train on.
Any new samples with unique feature combinations will likely improve the models generalisablity.
If the collection of new samples is not available, we can try to artificially create more through *data augmentation*.

This is a standard approach especially in computer vision applications. For example, from a single image, we can rotate it, flip it horizontally, shift it in any direction, crop it, and many other transformations without destroying the semantic content of the image.
But by doing so we are artificially increasing the size of the training set to help with overfitting.
In \autoref{fig:aug} we see how a single image of a cat is turned into eight images by doing random transformations of the original image.
In all of these images it is still possible to tell that it is an image of a cat.
Of course this is not as effective as genuine new data samples, but it is a very effective and efficient substitute [@Perez2017]. 
Data augmentation consistently leads to improved generalisation.

```{r, fig.cap="Example data augmentations for images.\\label{fig:aug}", out.width="80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/augmentations.png')
```

Data augmentation can be formalised by the *Vicinal Risk Minimisation* principle [@Chapelle2001] where human knowledge is required to describe a vicinity around each observation in the training data so that artificial examples can be drawn from the vicinity distribution of the training sample to enlarge it.
In image classification one can define the vicinity of an image as the set of its horizontal reflections and minor rotations, for example.

Note that data augmentation is dataset and domain dependent and that the augmentations should preserve the semantic content or the signal in the observation.
For example, taking too small crops of an image will ignore the context and may make it impossible to tell what is inside.
And augmentations that are suitable for image data does not necessarily make sense for text data.

## Modern Architectures

In the following sections we highlight some of the recently developed neural network layers and modules. 
These operations were designed to make training more robust and efficient, to help learn more robust representations and be able to model more useful features, among others.

### Normalisation \label{sec:bnorm}

One of the things that complicate the training of neural networks is the fact that hidden layers have to adapt to the continuously changing distribution of its inputs. 
The inputs to each layer are affected by the paramaters of all its preceding layers and a small change in a preceding layer can lead to a much bigger difference in output as the network becomes deeper. 
When the input distribution to a learning system changes, it is said to experience covariate shift [@Shimodaira2000].

Using ReLUs, carefull weight initialisation and small learning rates can help a network to deal with the internal covariate shift. 
However, a more effective way would be to ensure that the distribution of non-linearity inputs remains more stable while training the network.
[@Ioffe2015] proposed *batch normalisation* to do just that.

A batch normalisation layer normalises its inputs to a fixed mean and variance (similar to how the inputs of the network is normalised) and therefore it can be applied before any hidden layer in a network to prevent internal covariate shift. 
The addition of this layer dramatically accelerates the training of deep neural networks, also because it can be used with higher learning rates. 
It also helps with regularisation [@Ioffe2015], therefore in some cases dropout is not necessary.

The batch normalising transform over a batch of univariate inputs, $x_{1}, \dots,x_{n}$ is done by the following steps:

1. Calculate the mini-batch mean, $\mu$, and variance, $\sigma^{2}$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \mu &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\
    \sigma^{2}&=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-u)^{2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. Normalise the inputs, 

    $$
    \hat{x}_{i} = \frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}+\epsilon}},
    $$
    where $\epsilon$ is a constant to ensure numerical stability.

3. Scale and shift the values,

    $$
    y_{i}=\gamma\hat{x}_{i}+\beta,
    $$
    where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are the only two learnable paramaters of a batch normalisation layer.

The reason for the scale and shift step is to allow the layer to represent the identity transform if the normalised inputs are not suitable for the following layer, *i.e.* the scale and shift step will reverse the normalisation step if $\gamma=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}+\epsilon}$ and $\beta=\mu$. Batch normalisation has now become a standard when training deep CNNs.

### Skip-connections \label{sec:resnet}

Residual Networks became very popular after it was used to win one of the ImageNet competiions [@He2015].
The residual connection layer can simply be formalised as
$$
y=F(x)+x,
$$
*i.e.* combining the input to the layer(s) with the output of the layer(s).
Here, the combination is by addition, but other ways can also be used, like multiplication or concatenation.
The idea is also illustrated in \autoref{fig:skip_conn}.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Diagram conceptualising a skip-connection.\\label{fig:skip_conn}", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/skip_conn.png')
```

The DenseNet [@Huang2016] is another well-known network making use of skip connections.
In a DenseNet each layer is connected to every other layer in the network.
There are multiple benefits to using skip-connections: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and may reduce the number of parameters required [@Huang2016].
These benefits show in the empirical evaluations.
It is interesting to note that one can draw a parallel between ResNets and boosting methods since both are approaches to fitting a model to the residual [@Huang2017].

### Embeddings \label{sec:embeds}

An embedding is a layer that maps a discrete input to a numeric vector representation.
It was first used in NLP in order to represent words as numbers so that it can be processed by a numeric model.
For instance the word "woman" may be represented by the vector $[1,3,5]$ and the word "man" by $[2,4,6]$.
The goal is to map discrete inputs to a meaningful vector space where items with similar meaning exist close to each other.
In contrast to using a one-hot encoded representation of words, where all words equally far apart.
See \autoref{fig:emb} for an illustration of a such space[^emb_src].

```{r, fig.cap='Learned word embeddings in a 2-dimensional space.\\label{fig:emb}', fig.align="center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/embeds.png')
```

[^emb_src]: https://www.shanelynn.ie/get-busy-with-word-embeddings-introduction/

Initially the mappings were configured independenty of the neural network with approaches based on co-occurences [@Mikolov2013].
The real breakthrough came when the mappings were defined as learnable layers in the network (as done in all of the latest NLP research [@Howard2018, @Devlin2018]).
Thus they can be tuned just like any other parameter in the network.
The parameters of the embedding function (or layer) are first randomly initialised and then gets tuned along with the rest of the neural network during training.

An embedding operation can either be viewed as a table lookup or a matrix multiplication of the discrete input in a one-hot encoded form, *i.e.* $\boldsymbol{e}=W\boldsymbol{x}$ where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a discrete input in one-hot encoded form and $W:k\times p$ is the matrix containing the embedding where $p$ is the number discrete categories and $k$ is the embedding size.
The embedding layer can be reused by all input features with the same input type, making it more efficient and reducing the memory footprint of the model.

### Attention \label{sec:attention}

Attention is one of the standout breakthroughs made in deep learning in recent times; especially playing an integral part to NLP's success and other sequence related tasks [@Vaswani2017, @Devlin2018].
It was first popularised in neural machine translation [@Bahdanau2014] and now almost used ubiquitously in natural language processing applications.
It was also found useful in computer vision applications, like image captioning [@Xu2015], and in audio processing [@Duong2016].

The main idea of an attention module is to force a layer to only focus on a certain subset of its inputs at different stages of computation.
For example, in image captioning, one may use a RNN to sequentially output words describing the image.
With the use of an attention model, the network is restricted to only look at certain parts of an image at every step, avoiding having to look at the full image everytime.
This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:imattn}.
Notice how the network focusses on the bird part of the image when predicting the word "bird" and "flying" and then focussing on the water part of the image when predicting words like "body" and "water".
Similarly, when used in machine translation, we can visualise the attention weights to see how the network focusses on a different subset of words for predicting each word in the target language (\autoref{fig:nlpattn}).

```{r, fig.cap="Attention applied to image captioning.\\label{fig:imattn}", out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/img_attention.jpeg')
```

```{r, fig.cap="Attention applied to machine translation.\\label{fig:nlpattn}", out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/word_attn.png')
```

In an ideal world, an attention module should not be necessary and we would want the network to learn if certain parts of images are not required to look at.
However, currently this built-in prior proves to be extremely helpful with current learning algorithms.

The core of an attention module can be summarised with these equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{z}&=f(\boldsymbol{x})\\
\boldsymbol{\alpha} &=\text{softmax}(f_{att}(\boldsymbol{x}))\\
\boldsymbol{y}&=\boldsymbol{z}\otimes\boldsymbol{\alpha}
\end{aligned}
$$
$\boldsymbol{z}$ it the ordinary activations produced by a layer $f$ given input $\boldsymbol{x}$.
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ are the weights produced by the attention layer, $f_{att}$ after a logit transform so that the weights sum to one.
The output of the attention module, $\boldsymbol{y}$, is then an elementwise multiplication, $\otimes$, of $\boldsymbol{z}$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, however other combinatorial operations can also be used.
More detail can be found in [@Xu2015].
We will elaborate on the concepts of *Self-Attention* [@Cheng2016a] and *Multi-Head Attention* [@Vaswani2017] in \Cref{sec:tab_att}.

## One-cycle Policy \label{sec:onecyc}

The 1Cycle policy [@Smith2018] reduces training time and increases performance.

Currently the process of setting the hyper-parameters, including designing the network architecture, requires expertise and extensive trial and error and is based more on serendipity than science. 

Currently there are no simple and easy ways to set hyper-parameters – specifically, learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay.
Grid search or random search is expensive.
Optimal parameters make a huge difference in training time and performance.

Look for clues of overfitting and underfitting to determine best parameters.

The experiments discussed herein indicate that the learning rate, momentum, and regularization are tightly coupled and optimal values must be determined together.

by monitoring validation/test loss early in the training, enough information is available to tune the
architecture  and  hyper-parameters  and  this  eliminates  the  necessity  of  running  complete  grid  or
random searches.

Underfitting is when the machine learning model is unable to reduce the error for either the test or
training set.  The cause of underfitting is an under
capacity
of the machine learning model; that is,
it is not powerful enough to fit the underlying complexities of the data distributions.  Overfitting
happens  when  the  machine  learning  model  is  so  powerful  as  to  fit  the  training  set  too  well  and
the generalization error increases.

The takeaway is that
achieving the horizontal part of the test loss is the goal of hyper-
parameter tuning

The art of setting the network’s hyper-parameters amounts to ending up at the balance point between
underfitting and overfitting

If the learning rate (LR) is too small, overfitting can occur.  Large learning rates help to regularize
the training but if the learning rate is too large, the training will diverge.

To use CLR, one specifies minimum and maximum learning rate boundaries and a stepsize. The
stepsize is the number of iterations (or epochs) used for each step and a cycle consists of two such
steps – one in which the learning rate linearly increases from the minimum to the maximum and
the other in which it linearly decreases. 

n the LR range test, training starts with a small learning rate which is slowly increased linearly
throughout a pre-training run.  This single run provides valuable information on how well the net-
work can be trained over a range of learning rates and what is the maximum learning rate.  When
starting with a small learning rate, the network begins to converge and, as the learning rate increases,
it eventually becomes too large and causes the test/validation loss to increase and the accuracy to
decrease.  The learning rate at this extrema is the largest value that can be used as the learning rate
for the maximum bound with cyclical learning rates but a smaller value will be necessary when
choosing a constant learning rate or the network will not begin to converge.

the amount of regularization must be balanced for each dataset
and architecture

Contrary to this early work, this Section recommends using a larger batch size when using
the 1cycle learning rate schedule, which is described in the above

Weight decay is one form of regularization and it plays an important role in training so its value needs
to be set properly.  The important point made above applies; that is, practitioners must balance the
various forms of regularization to obtain good performance. the interested reader can see kuka et al. (2017) for a review of regularization methods.

1.  Learning rate (LR): Perform a learning rate range test to a “large” learning rate.  The max
LR depends on the architecture (for the shallow 3-layer architecture, large is 0.01 while for
resnet, large is 3.0), you might try more than one maximum.  Using the 1cycle LR policy
with a maximum learning rate determined from an LR range test, a minimum learning rate
as a tenth of the maximum appears to work well but other factors are relevant, such as the
rate of learning rate increase (too fast and increase will cause instabilities).

2.  Total batch size (TBS): A large batch size works well but the magnitude is typically con-
strained by the GPU memory. If your server has multiple GPUs, the total batch size is the
batch size on a GPU multiplied by the number of GPUs. If the architecture is small or your
hardware permits very large batch sizes, then you might compare performance of different
batch sizes.  In addition, recall that small batch sizes add regularization while large batch
sizes add less, so utilize this while balancing the proper amount of regularization. It is often
better to use a larger batch size so a larger learning rate can be used.

3.  Momentum:  Short runs with momentum values of 0.99, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.9 will quickly
show the best value for momentum. If using the 1cycle learning rate schedule, it is better to
use a cyclical momentum (CM) that starts at this maximum momentum value and decreases
with increasing learning rate to a value of 0.8 or 0.85 (performance is almost independent
of the minimum momentum value).  Using cyclical momentum along with the LR range
test stabilizes the convergence when using large learning rate values more than a constant
momentum does.

4.  Weight decay (WD): This requires a grid search to determine the proper magnitude but
usually  does  not  require  more  than  one  significant  figure  accuracy.   Use  your  knowl-
edge of the dataset and architecture to decide which values to test.  For example, a more
complex dataset requires less regularization so test smaller weight decay values. A  shallow  architecture  requires  more  regularization  so  test  largerweight decay values.

## Model Interpretation \label{sec:interp}

Although Deep Learning is now the state-of-the-art for many machine learning tasks, it is still trailing behind other algorithms in terms of model interpretability.
But keep in mind this is not an unusual trade-off; between prediction performance and model interpretability.
DNNs are occasionally referred to as "black boxes" since it is very difficult to interpret what is going on inside the stacks of linear and non-linear layers.
This is one of deep learning's greatest criticisms and is a large reason why it cannot be used in some production environments. 
For example, in the clinical domain, model transparency is of utmost importance, given that predictions might be used to affect real-world medical decision-making and patient treatments [@Shickel2017].

Fortunately, some work has been done to gain insights from NNs.

### Neural Network Specific

We have showed previously that it is possible to inspect activations and weights of layers at different levels of the network.
If the network is small, one might gain insight to what the network has learned or why it is making certain decisions.
However, most useful neural networks are at least three layers deep, making its activations and weights more complex to interpret.

When fully convolutional networks are used, there are ways to visualise which parts of the inputs were important in making a certain decision.
These visualisations are called class activation maps.
But they cannot be used with fully connected layers.

Another common interpretation tool, in order to gain insight into what specific neurons are looking for, is to rank the inputs by the magnitude of their activation at that neuron.
Then, if one would be able to manually spot similarities between the highest ranked inputs, one would have a potential description of the pattern that triggers that neuron.
This process is manual and not guarranteed to produce useful insights, especially when there are many neurons to investigate.

### Model Agnostic

#### Permutation Importance

[@haldar2018] notes that the permutation test only produces sensical results on the assumption that the features are independent.
Permuting the feature independently created examples that never occurred in real life, and the importance of features in that invalid space sent us in the wrong direction. 
The test however is somewhat useful in determining features that were not pulling their weight.
If randomly permuting a feature did not affect the model performance at all, it was a good indication that the model is probably not dependent on it.
