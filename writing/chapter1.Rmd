# Introduction

Deep learning resulted in tremendous improvements in many machine learning applications, especially in the domains of image, text and audio processing. The datasets in these domains are what some call unstructured data. Why is it called unstructured? In a sense the data is homogeneous. Cite reviews of deep learning in these domains. Show the growth of deep learning papers, conference applications and deep learning software. But where we havenâ€™t seen much exploration of deep learning is applying it to structure data also referred to as tabular data. Tabular data is also important. But each column is different and thus in a way more difficult to learn representations. At the moment methods on tabular data are dominated by tree based boosting methods. See kaggle competitions. In some cases where there was enough data deep learning got a slight upperhand. But it is still not clear when a tabular dataset is best suited for dl and neither how then to apply dl to such a dataset. This thesis acts as an tutorial on applying dl to tabular data. We will look at existing work on the matter, see that it is lacking, see what we can borrow from the other domains, do an empirical study to look for clues. Especially layers, embeddings, pretraining, augementation, modern training policies, batch size. The use of dl is often restricted by its perceived lack of interpretability and the here we will explore ways that we can interpret them with model agnostic and nn specific methods. 

Deep learning is a revitalization of artifical neural networks or multilayer perceptrons.  Nns have been use on tabular data but old techniques and very few of the moden techniques have been tested on tabular data.
